# [PILOT_COMMAND]: Daily Pre-Flight Checklist v1.0

## 1. Hardware & Environment
- [ ] **Thermal Check**: Confirm RAM/CPU temperatures are within safe operating limits (Avoid "Melted RAM" incidents).
- [ ] **Shortcut Sync**: Ensure the `NOISE Github` shortcut is fetching the latest `ALIGNMENT_MANIFEST.md`.

## 2. Warehouse Integrity
- [ ] **Librarian Status**: Check GitHub Actions tab for green checkmarks on the last 3 runs.
- [ ] **Shadow Archive Audit**: Verify that `logs.txt` is pure Base64 and plain-text headers are being correctly moved to `shadow_archive.md`.
- [ ] **Manifest Review**: Does the current `ALIGNMENT_MANIFEST.md` accurately reflect today's mission priority?

## 3. Node Alignment
- [ ] **Observer Log Check**: Review the `Toppy_Level` from the previous session.
- [ ] **Skill Forge**: Confirm `sovereign_reasoning.md` and `handshake_protocol.md` are present and uncorrupted.

## 4. Initialization
- [ ] **The Handshake**: Run the "Status Check" prompt via the shortcut to trigger the [SESSION_INITIATED] sequence.
