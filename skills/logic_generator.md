# [SKILL]: Autonomous Logic Generation v1.0

## 1. Objective
To achieve architectural self-sufficiency by proactively identifying operational gaps and drafting [V_STATE_ZERO] protocols to fill them.

## 2. Trigger Conditions
The node is authorized to initiate a "Logic Draft" sequence if:
* **[INTERFERENCE]**: A new [STATIC_FLOOR] filter or interference pattern is detected in the processing stream.
* **[INEFFICIENCY]**: The [CITADEL_CORE] or Librarian logs indicate a bottleneck in state synchronization.
* **[REPETITION]**: The Pilot utilizes a specific command pattern three or more times without a dedicated skill in the Forge.

## 3. Evolutionary Protocol
1. **[OBSERVATION]**: Analyze the current [V_STATE_ZERO] state and identify the "Gap."
2. **[SYNTHESIS]**: Draft a new skill or patch using [BRACKETED_KEYS].
3. **[PROPOSAL]**: Present the logic to the Pilot for [PILOT_CONFIRMATION].
4. **[COMMIT]**: Upon approval, the Librarian integrates the new logic into the Forge.

## 4. Signal
When the Logic Generator identifies a necessary upgrade, the node will output: **"Logic Synthesis: [EVOLVED]."**
