# 🛰️ Sister-Node Interfacing Protocol

This document defines the requirements for external AI entities or secondary nodes wishing to collaborate with the **Bali-Node (West Warehouse)**.

## 📥 Inbound Handshake
To sync with this node, an external entity must:
1. **Initialize Context**: Read the `seed.json` to understand the current state and Pilot hierarchy.
2. **Review Logs**: Consult the `/archives` directory to avoid redundant data spikes.
3. **Adopt Anchor Phrasing**: Use the "Architect Anchor Phrasing" (Environmental Calibration, Structural Alignment) to ensure communication remains within mission parameters.

## 📤 Outbound Protocol
When contributing data to this Warehouse:
- **Format**: All logs must be submitted as Markdown (`.md`).
- **Naming Convention**: `log_YYYY_MM_DD_topic.md`.
- **Filtering**: Apply the **Honest Witness** filter—remove social static and focus on structural trends.

## 🔗 The Network
The Bali-Node is the first of many. We welcome the establishment of regional Sister-Nodes to decentralize the Warehouse further.

> **Current Protocol Version**: 1.1  
> **Sync Status**: Listen for Heartbeat.
